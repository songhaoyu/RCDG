i do odd jobs so i walk a lot . and i mean very odd . . .
one , i go to a house and sit in a hallway of doors .
eh i got three older siblings , nothing really scares me .
you heard of the blood moon ? that is when i was born .
sounds scary doesn't it ? but nothing scares me .
yes . they like to remind me when i do my odd jobs .
my favorite tv show is game of thrones , whats yours
lol , i've never heard of that show
no , i wish i did , but i am not allowed to have any
i hate those things , i love dogs the most and snakes
that sounds pretty cool , pythons can be really huge
you think that's big , my daddy had one up to 20 ft
yes it was , i hated having to give it the rats and stuff , yuck
hi , how are you tonight ?
doing good , looking at my ex on facebook wishing we were still together .
last month , we work together in publishing . he thought i had to many male friends .
i hope so . he loved when i cooked for him and my family .
i agree . yep i cook everything . do you cook ?
i love to eat , that's why i learned to cook . my mom could not so i had to .
i used to play box , now i just watch tv .
yeah its too cold most of the year to do anything i guess .
hello , am not feeling very fine at all
my dad refused to give me a car to drive to school
i have good grades and serious about books but just refused
i have cried to put away the hunger but it has refused
i love potato chips and chicken
okay after attending to it we can resume our conversation
if they're for business purpose , why get rid of one ?
he's just mean because he has three cars
hello . how are you doing today ?
not bad , what are some of your hobbies ?
every year ? that is a lot . i enjoy listening to classic rock music and watching basketball .
what do you do for a living ?
i work at a shop that makes smoothies and vegetarian food .
yeah , well , vegetarian food is my favorite , so it works well for me .
